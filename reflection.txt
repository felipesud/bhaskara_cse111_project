Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
At first, I was a little lost and by applying the content in extra exercises I could see how much easier it is to develop using functions.
Today I can't think of a "loose" code on the screen, I can only see numbers on a mission.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
First, it helps to monitor the behavior of my system's functions, that is, I can tell if it's failing, even before running the entire code to the user.
The other advantage is how much time you save worrying about tests, after all, rework can be harmful to the project.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
I  try to break the problem into smaller pieces that I can solve with what I know of the language to put together a "puzzle" with this problem. I need to improve prior knowledge, knowing different paradigms, functions, etc. So that when I come across a similar problem, I have baggage and a source to find.
